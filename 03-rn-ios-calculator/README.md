React Native implementation of a calculator that uses reusable components, custom hooks, math calculations, and Flex styling to achieve the desired look and feel.

Specifically we see:
- flex-layout
- useState
- useRef
- useCalculator - Custom Hook
- View
- SafeAreaView
- Text
- StyleSheets
- overall theme
- Conditional Styles

In the end, we have a clear idea of how to be able to work in React Native and be able to use the knowledge of React in mobile applications.
