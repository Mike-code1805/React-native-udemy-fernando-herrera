# 04-navigation-app
This section consists of two parts in which we see the types of navigation that we have at our disposal.

We start with the Stack and Drawer navigation, the understanding of each of the different navigation controls is a fundamental piece in any mobile application, so we try to learn each one of them to be able to mix them and achieve the objective for our application.

# Context
The goal of this section is to learn how components communicate with each other, regardless of their location in the component tree.

We learn to put the type to everything and use the context to be able to render the components again when changes arise.
